Cynnedy here. I used a TRS-80 to learn Basic programming in the 1980s, used a little html coding to set up a couple of webpages on geocities.com in the 1990s, and am currently using Google's CS-First with Scratch from MIT to introduce coding to students in the afterschool program at the elementary school where I work as a special ed teacher.
